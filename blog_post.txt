Definition of CRUD

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. These are the basic building
blocks of interacting with data inside a database.

Definition of SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. This is the most common
language used to communicate with databases.

Create = The SQL command for create is INSERT.  This will create new rows in
          a table.
          An example of this might be;
          INSERT INTO "students" (NAME) VALUES ('Brian');
This inserts the name 'Brian' into the students column with a value of name.

Read = The SQL command for read is SELECT. This selects the specified
      information from the table.
      An example of this might be:
      SELECT * FROM students;
This selects the students from the database.

Update = The SQL for update is UPDATE. This enables us to update existing values
        in our database.
        An example of this might be:
        UPDATE "students" SET NAME = 'Brian' WHERE ID = 1;
This is updating the ID position of 1 with the name 'Brian'.

Delete = The SQL for delete is DELETE. This will remove a row from the table.
        An example of this might be:
        DELETE FROM 'students' WHERE NAME = 'Brian'
This would delete the row where the name value is 'Brian'.
